# TODO

## Create simulates test cases for lme4 

### Single site
- with phylogenetic signals (hacked lme4 object cannot simulate)
- phylogenetic signals with uncorrelated slopes
- phylogenetic signals with correlated slopes

## match test cases with pez

### Multiple sites
- with phylogenetic signals
- phylogenetic signals by sites (compound symmetric case)
- phylogenetic signals by site with uncorrelated slopes
- phylogenetic signals by site with correlated slopes 
-
