# TODO

## Create simulates test cases for lme4 

### Single site
- with phylogenetic signals (hacked lme4 object cannot simulate)
- phylogenetic signals with uncorrelated slopes
- phylogenetic signals with correlated slopes

## match test cases with pez

### Multiple sites
- with phylogenetic signals
- phylogenetic signals by sites (compound symmetric case)
- phylogenetic signals by site with uncorrelated slopes
- phylogenetic signals by site with correlated slopes 




Three sample sizes:
Small: 20 sp by 20 sites
Medium: 100 sp by 20 sites
Large: 1000 sp by 20 sites

Crazy case: 5000 by 20 sites
(Cannot alocate memory 10k +)
